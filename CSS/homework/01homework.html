 		<p>The Trump<span> [Twitter]</span> administration scrambled on Tuesday to show it wasn’t snubbing Puerto Rico, with the White House trotting out officials to describe an aggressive federal response to Hurricane Maria’s devastation and President Donald Trump insisting he’s gotten “good marks” for the relief efforts.  </p>
 		<p>Trump and his aides have found themselves on the defensive for the president’s muted response to the latest storm, which devastated the island and left millions of American citizens without electricity, housing or running water.	</p>
 		<p>White House officials have bristled at the contention that they were caught flat-footed by the severity of Maria, while Trump himself has been frustrated by the constant coverage on cable news about whether he’s doing enough, administration officials said. Trump also appeared to be particularly sensitive to perceived criticism from Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who publicly called for more help from the federal government — before later praising the president's efforts.</p>
 		<p>“I’d push back strongly on that notion. It’s not accurate,” one official said on Tuesday when asked about claims that Trump didn’t act quickly to draw attention to the crisis, adding that the president and his team are in “constant contact” with federal agencies and first responders.</p>
 		<p>Trump has faced mounting criticism from lawmakers, Puerto Rican officials, and prominent political figures including Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney, who alleged that the president wasn’t doing enough to help the island — and was instead focused on his feud with kneeling NFL players.</p>
 		<p>In response, the administration on Tuesday rolled out a public relations campaign.

 		Officials added a high-level White House meeting on the hurricane to Trump’s schedule. They distributed a series of statistics about relief efforts. They trotted out the heads of FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security to talk to reporters on the driveway outside the West Wing. And they organized a meeting at the White House with Vice President Mike Pence, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Del. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member in the House of Representatives.</p>
